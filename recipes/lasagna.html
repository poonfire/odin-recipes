    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <p>The <strong><em>BEST</em></strong> easy, classic lasagna recipe made with a <em>ground beef meat sauce, no- cook noodles, and cottage cheese</em> for extra protein!</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb 93% lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>28 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>12 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>24 oz part-skim cottage cheese</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375F degrees.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet, when hot add the ground beef, onion, and garlic and cook over medium-high heat, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon until no pink remains.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and black pepper, to taste, cover and let it simmer over low heat 20 minutes, stirring 3 times.</li>
            <li>In large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and combine with 1 1/2 containers cottage cheese, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese, Pecorino Romano and parsley. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a 13 x 9 casserole dish, spread 1 cup of sauce on bottom of pan. Layer in the order, 4 uncooked lasagna noodles (it's okay if they overlap), then 1/3 of the cheese mixture, 1 cup of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Repeat the next layer using 4 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1/3 part of the cheese mixture, and 1 cup sauce. For the top layer add the remaining sauce and finish with 1 cup mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Cover tight with foil and bake 55 to 60 minutes, until the pasta is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Uncover and continue cooking until all the cheese browns slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh parsley, and let sit 5 minutes before cutting. Slice into 8 pieces.</li>
        </ol>
