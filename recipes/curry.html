            <li>1 14-ounce package extra-firm tofu, drained</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Olive oil spray</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped peanuts</li>
            <h3>For the "Rice"</h3>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 scallions, white and green separated</li>
            <li>1 12-ounce package riced cauliflower, fresh or frozen</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Drain the tofu:</strong> Place tofu on a paper towel or tea towel lined plate. Cover with another towel and place a heavy pan on top to press out excess water from tofu.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Marinade:</strong> Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons soy sauce and the grated garlic clove. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut tofu into cubes:</strong> Transfer the tofu to a cutting board, flip on its side and slice in half lengthwise. Flip it back over to lay flat on the cutting board and cut into 32 equal cubes. Place in a medium size shallow container or dish so the cubes are in 1 even layer.</li>
            <li><strong>Season the tofu:</strong> Sprinkle with curry powder, turning to coat all sides. Pour sauce from the bowl over the tofu, flipping pieces to make sure they are evenly coated. Marinate for at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Peanut Sauce:</strong> After transferring the tofu marinade to the shallow dish, add the peanut butter, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, sriracha and 1 teaspoon ginger to the small bowl.  Whisk to combine, adding warm water a little at a time to thin to pourable consistency (I added about 2 ½ tablespoons).  Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Air Fry:</strong> Spray the air fryer basket with oil. Transfer the tofu to the air fryer in a single layer and air fry 370F 12-14 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cook time, until golden and crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Cauliflower Rice:</strong> Meanwhile, heat a medium skillet over medium heat.  Add the olive oil, swirling to coat the pan.  Add the minced garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger and scallion whites. Sauté for 30 seconds then add the cauliflower rice.  Sprinkle with salt and sauté for 4-5 minutes, stirring often.</li>
            <li><strong>Toss with Peanut Sauce:</strong> Transfer tofu from the air fryer basket to the same shallow dish from marinating (if desired), add the sauce and toss to coat.</li>
            <li><strong>To serve:</strong> In 2 shallow bowls, layer each with ½ the cauliflower rice and half the tofu.  Top each with scallion greens and peanuts.</li>

        </ol>
