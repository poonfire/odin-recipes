Project-Recipes: "The Odin Project"
I did this project assigned by the Odin Project. Most of the material, I had some familiarity with, from other free online courses, but it was a good refresher. With the addition of GitHub integration, and using terminal to create and update files, this finally felt like I was doing something of worth. Looking forward to future assignements.
